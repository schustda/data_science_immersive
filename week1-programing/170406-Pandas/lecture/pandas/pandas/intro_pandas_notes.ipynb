    "# Intro to Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to be starting our journey through the Pandas library (created by Wes McKinney). When we refer to working in Pandas, we're typically talking about working within a dataframe, which is what we'll focus on today. We'll be diving into Pandas DataFrames, which are objects that will hold our data, allowing us to interact with it, manipulate it, and eventually throw it into machine learning algorithms (if we want). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today's notes are aimed at breadth, instead of depth. There are tons and tons (and tons) of things you can do with Pandas (other than admire how adorable they are), and as a result this lecture is aimed at giving you an idea of what you can do with it, as opposed to walking through everything in detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/pandas3.jpg\" width=300 />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pandas` DataFrame is going to be one of the Python objects that you interact with the most. It'll be used to store your data, to manipulate/process your data, and to ultimately move your data into a machine learning model/algorithm. To that end, it's important that you are comfortable using and interacting with `pandas` DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a Pandas DataFrame is an **object**, this means that we're going to interact with it in much the same way that we interact with all of our other objects in python. Before we get to actually interacting with DataFrames, though, we'll have to get one, and get one with data in it! There's one quick step that we have to do before that... \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Import \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd # Standard import. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I've shown how we get access to everything in the Pandas library - we import it! Also note the python comment `\"# Standard import\"` out to the right of our import. This was to note that this is the standard way to import the Pandas library. We should always be sure that if we are importing the entire pandas library, we follow this syntax. It's common practice to use `pd` as the alias, and we tend to follow common practice whenever possible. This makes it easier for others to read our code."

    "## Getting a DataFrame Object\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic ways that we can get a Pandas DataFrame object to work with. The first is by using data that is already in our Python program, in conjuction with the `DataFrame` constructor. The second is by reading in external data through the pandas module (which remembered we've imported and made accessible via `pd`). For reference, here are the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html) for Pandas DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using data already in our Python program\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are using data that is already in our Python program, then we are going to be passing that data to the `DataFrame` constructor. We typically do this in one of two ways. The first involves passing in a list of dictionaries, whereas the second involves passing in two lists. Let's dive into the first..."

Above, we can look at our columns and see that their names are `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. We can similiary look at our rows and see that they are indexed by `0` and `1`. These column names and indices are how we will access this data later. How did the `DataFrame` constructor take our list of dictionaries and put it into the DataFrame in that format, though?\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Pandas DataFrame constructor encounters a list of dictionaries like we gave it, it interprets each dictionary to be a row in the DataFrame. The keys are read as the column names and the values as the values for each column. By default, the DataFrame constructor will assign a column for **every** key that it sees in **any** dictionary in the list of dictionaries. If a particular dictionary in that list doesn't have a value for that key, then it assigns a `NaN` (stands for not a number) value for that index-column pair. Therefore, when the Pandas DataFrame above got the list of dictionaries, it saw `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` keys, and thus created those columns. It then filled in the values associated with those keys, filling in a `NaN` if it didn't find that key (like it didn't find `d` in the first dictionary in our list). "

    "Pandas has functions for both filling nulls (or N/As) with whatever value we want, or dropping nulls all together. To fill nulls, we use the `.fillna()` method on the DataFrame, and to drop nulls, we call the `.dropna()` method on the DataFrame. In terms of the `.fillna()` function, we can give it a default value to fill in, or a number of other methods to fill it in (padding, back filling, foward filling). You can read about dealing with missing data in the docs [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#cleaning-filling-missing-data). We're not going to go into too much depth here, but want you to know that this functionality exists. "

    "You might have noticed that in a couple of places, when we asked for certain rows/columns of the data, we got back a 1-D array that had an index attached. These are examples of what Pandas calls `Series`. In the documentation for [Pandas Series](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.15.2/dsintro.html#series), you can get an idea of what they can do. For the most part, we can kind of treat them like a mini DataFrame, as they have a lot of the same methods. However, there are some slight differences.

    "# Combining Datasets with Pandas \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas functions that allow us to combine two sets of data include the use of `pd.merge()`, `df.join()`, `df.merge()`, and `pd.concat()`. For the most part, these do largely the same things (although you'll notice the slight syntax difference with `merge()` and `concat()` being able to be called via the Pandas module and `merge()` and `join()` being able to be called on a DataFrame instance). There are some cases where one of these might be better than another in terms of writing less code or performing some kind of data combination in an easier way. The major differences between these, though, largely depend on what they do by default when you try to combine different data. By default, `merge()` looks to join on common columns, `join()` on common indices, and `concat()` by just appending on a given axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more detail about the differences between all three of these in the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html). We'll look at some examples below. "

    "## A quick look at vizualization in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous libraries available in Python for creating vizualizations. Often times, we will probably be using [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and/or [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for anything that is general purpose, and then other libraries if we need something more specialized ([Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for dashboards, for example). All of these libraries allow us to build great looking visualizations that can be used in a production setting. If we want something quick and dirty to visualize our data very easily, there is also some plotting functionality built into Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html), we can see that the plotting available with Pandas will be called via the `plot()` method on a DataFrame object. From there, we'll pass in a bunch of potential arguments to the `plot()` method to specify exactly how to build the plot. The most important of those arguments is the `kind` keyword argument, which tells the `plot()` method what kind of visualization we would like (bar plot, histogram, scatter plot, etc.). Today we'll look at one or two examples - since most of the time we'll be doing your visualization in Matplotlib or Seaborn, we'll just give you a taste of what Pandas can do so that you know it's there. We'll look at Seaborn and Matplotlib in a little bit more depth in a later class. "

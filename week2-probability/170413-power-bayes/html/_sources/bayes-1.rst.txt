Bayesian Inference
====================================================

Mini-bbjectives:

1. Discuss the philosophy
2. Review conditional probability
3. Bayes Rule
4. Discuss Bayesian inference

Bayes Theorem
----------------

   :math:`P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}`    

   :math:`P(\theta|x) = \frac{P(x|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(x)}`    


Here are the slides:

Pair Assignment:

   * Do part 0 and part 1
   * For part 2 you may instead go through the following notebook

      `Introduction to PyMC3 <https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios8366/blob/master/notebooks/Section4_4-Introduction-to-PyMC3.ipynb>`_

Individual assignement
===========================

Everyone should do Part 0 and Part 1 of the assignment.

   * Read/write CSV between as a way to communicate between R and Python
   * get familiar with calculating pwr and the factors that influence it

The Python part
--------------------
     
   1. Read in the MTCARS data into Python.
   2. Create a new column by converting mpg Miles/(US) gallon to liter/100 Kilometers
   3. Create a new column with 'high' and 'low' horse power splitting the data at the median
   4. Save the new data frame as a CSV


The R part
-------------------

   5. Create an empty .R file and run carry out the rest of the steps in that script
   6. Load the CSV into R
   7. Run an ANOVA on the Horse Power groups wit MPG as the response variable http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~martin/W2024/R3.pdf
   8. From http://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html go through each of the example boxes at the end of the page

      
.. note:: Yes you can run R from within Jupyter and yes you can run R from within Python (rpy2) but here I want you to use a script 

	  
Getting started
----------------
      
To execute your script From a terminal type:

.. code:: bash

   ~$ Rscript myscript.R


This is how you plot the mtcars data in Python

.. code-block:: python
   
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import statsmodels.api as sm
   % matplotlib inline
   from pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix

   mtcars2 = sm.datasets.get_rdataset('mtcars')
   df = pd.DataFrame(mtcars2.data)
   scatter_matrix(df[[0,2,3,4,5]], alpha=0.3, figsize=(8, 8), diagonal='kde', marker='o');

This is how you read a csv into an R dataframe

.. code:: r

   mtcars <- read.csv(outfileName)
   attach(x)
   print(names(x))
   print(mean(x$some_feature))
   

To plot the mcars data using the built in data

.. code:: r

   library(lattice)

   # scatterplot matrix
   pdf("cars_in_r.pdf",height=6,width=6)
   splom(mtcars[c(1,3,4,5,6)], main="MTCARS Data")
   dev.off()

.. note:: `mtcars` is a built in data set in R so if you use that

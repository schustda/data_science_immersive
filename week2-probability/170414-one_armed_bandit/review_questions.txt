Review DSI
Week 0 and Week 1

SQL

* What is an RDBMS?
    * Rational Database Management System

* What is a schema?
    * The set of all tables within the database

* What does SQL stand for and what is it?
    * Structured Querey Language

* How do you access information stored in SQL databases?

* What are the two main parts of a SQL query?

* The following questions pertain to specific SQL commands:
    * How do you constrain the number of records returned by a query?
    * How do you sort sort the order of records returned by a query?
    * How do you group rows together?
    * How do you find specific rows in a table...
        * Before an aggregation?
        * After an aggregation?

* Name 3 types of joins and draw Venn diagram examples of them.

* How might you improve the readability of a large, complicated query?  Think both
  regarding syntax and the formation of other tables.


Probability

* What is Bayes rule?  What does it relate?

* What is combinatorics?

* How many ways can I arrange n unique objects?

* How many ways can I arrange k of n unique objects, where k < n?  What is this called?

* If order doesn't matter, how many ways can I pick of n objects? What is this called?

* What is a random variable?

* How would you define the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?

* What distribution would you use to model the following cases:
    * What is the probability that the mean volume of 50 bottles is less than 500 ml?
        * Normal
    * Deciding to go for a run or not.
        * Bernoulli
    * Determining how many days pass before you finally decide to go for a run.
        * Geometric
    * Determining how likely it is that you go for 10 runs in a month.
        * Poisson
    * Calculating how much water falls into an open swimming pool during a rain storm.
        * Uniform
    * Assuming you run at a 9 minute mile pace avg pace, determining how likely
      it is that you pass the 3 mile mark in a race in 25 minutes?
        * Poisson


Estimation-sampling

* What is the central limit theorem?
    *

* How would you go about implementing a bootstrap, and why would you do it?
    * Resample the sample with replacement. You would do it when you don't have enough data


Hypothesis testing

* What are the general steps of a hypothesis tests?  Make one up (something you'd test)
  and go through the steps.
  * Set a null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not true

* What is a p value?
    *
* What is a type I error?

* What is a type II error?


Power

* What are the four factors that influence power?
    * Sample Size, Effect Size, Significance level, and variance

* In Bayes rule, what are the posterior, the likelihood, and the prior distributions?
  How are they related?
    * Posterior is prior belief, likelihood is the chance of happening given the prior. Prior is the known distributions
